  This allows you to define a group of power switches. 
  Each power switch in the group is controlled by a GPIO. 
  Each power switch is defined in a child node of the power-switches node.

  Here is an example which defines two power switches in the node /power-switches:

  / {
  	power_switches {
  		compatible = "gpio-power-switches";
  		power_switch_1V8 {
  			gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
  		};
  		power_switch_3V3 {
  			gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
  		};
  	};
  };

  Above:

  - power_switch_1V8 is pin 1 on gpio0. The 1.8V power is on when the pin is high,
    and off when the pin is low.
  - power_switch_3V3 is pin 2 on gpio0. The 3.3V power is on when the pin is high,
    and off when it is low.

compatible: "gpio-power-switches"

        Human readable string describing the power switch. It can be used by an
        application to identify the power switch or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
